# Introduction

A obsidian like markdown viewer, editor and linker and an excuse for me to learn lua and some neovim API

# Roadmap
- Edit and Render markdown
- Render a clickable local link

# How it works?

## Normal mode
- view rendered markdown/HTML
- resolve local links

## Insert mode
- change raw markdown
